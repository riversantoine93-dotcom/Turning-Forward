## 1. Upload to GitHub

Create a new empty GitHub repository. Upload the **contents of this folder** so `package.json` is at the repository root.

The GitHub root must look like:

```text
app/
components/
lib/
public/
supabase/
package.json
next.config.ts
```

Do not place everything inside an extra folder.

## 2. Configure Supabase

Open the Supabase project at:

```text
https://hgcdchahcdncxbmzjfwk.supabase.co
```

In **SQL Editor**, run:

```text
supabase/schema.sql
```

In **Authentication > URL Configuration**, add your Vercel production URL to the allowed redirect URLs. After connecting the custom domain, also add:

```text
https://learn.theconvictionfictionpodcast.com/**
```

## 3. Deploy to Vercel

1. In Vercel, choose **Add New > Project**.
2. Import the GitHub repository.
3. Leave **Root Directory** blank.
4. Framework Preset should be **Next.js**.
5. Do not override Install, Build, or Output commands.
6. Add these environment variables for Production, Preview, and Development:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hgcdchahcdncxbmzjfwk.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_ne89Tdh-ImkmhlsBT9ItbQ_k_TgpRAe
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_COURSE_URL=https://theconvictionfictionpodcast.com/collections/courses
```

7. Deploy.

## 4. View as an end user

After deployment, open the Vercel URL. The end-user flow is:

```text
/                  public landing page
/register          create a student account
/login             student sign in
/dashboard         student dashboard
/course/turning-forward
/course/turning-forward/module-1
/profile
```

For a fast preview without creating an account, open `/course/turning-forward/module-1`. Guest answers save only in that browser. Authenticated student answers sync to Supabase.

## Important production note

This build provides student authentication and learning progress. It does not yet verify a Shopify purchase before granting access. Before paid launch, add Shopify order verification through a secure server-side webhook and an enrollment table. Never put a Shopify Admin API token in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variable.

## Video replacement

Each lesson currently contains a branded video placeholder. Replace the `Video` component in:

```text
app/course/turning-forward/[module]/page.tsx
```

with protected Vimeo, Mux, or another video embed.
